### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Code Blocks

This analysis provides a comprehensive breakdown of each code block in the provided script, focusing on its functionality, syntactical details, and role in demonstrating the use of ChromaDB for vector search and the limitations of simple vector search. The code is part of a lab exercise titled "Lab 2 - Pitfalls of retrieval - when simple vector search fails!" and is designed to explore semantic search on Microsoft's 2022 annual report.

#### Background and Context
The code leverages ChromaDB, an open-source vector database designed for storing and retrieving vector embeddings, commonly used in tasks like semantic search and large language model training. From research, ChromaDB is noted for its ability to store embeddings with metadata, support vector search, and integrate with embedding models like Sentence Transformers ([ChromaDB Overview](https://medium.com/@kbdhunga/an-overview-of-chromadb-the-vector-database-206437541bdd)). The script also uses UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for dimensionality reduction, enabling visualization of high-dimensional embeddings in 2D space, which is crucial for understanding document relationships ([UMAP Documentation](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).

The overall objective is to demonstrate how vector search works, visualize the embedding space, and highlight cases where simple vector search might fail, such as with ambiguous or out-of-context queries (e.g., "What has Michael Jordan done for us lately?").

#### Block-by-Block Analysis

##### Block 1: Setup and Loading ChromaDB Collection
```python
from helper_utils import load_chroma, word_wrap
from chromadb.utils.embedding_functions import SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction

embedding_function = SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction()

chroma_collection = load_chroma(filename='microsoft_annual_report_2022.pdf', collection_name='microsoft_annual_report_2022', embedding_function=embedding_function)
chroma_collection.count()
```
- **Purpose**: This block sets up the environment by importing necessary utilities and loading a ChromaDB collection. The `load_chroma` function likely handles loading the PDF, splitting it into chunks, generating embeddings using `SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction`, and storing them in ChromaDB. The `count()` method checks the number of items in the collection.
- **Syntactical Nuances**: 
  - The `load_chroma` function is custom, assumed to be defined in `helper_utils`, and not part of standard libraries. It takes parameters like `filename`, `collection_name`, and `embedding_function`.
  - `SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction` is instantiated for generating sentence embeddings, a utility from ChromaDB.
  - The `count()` method is called on the collection object, returning the total number of documents or embeddings.
- **Contribution**: This block prepares the data for vector search by loading pre-processed embeddings of the annual report into memory, essential for subsequent queries and visualizations.

##### Block 2: Retrieving Embeddings and Fitting UMAP
```python
import umap
import numpy as np
from tqdm import tqdm

embeddings = chroma_collection.get(include=['embeddings'])['embeddings']
umap_transform = umap.UMAP(random_state=0, transform_seed=0).fit(embeddings)
```
- **Purpose**: This block retrieves all embeddings from the ChromaDB collection and fits a UMAP model to them. UMAP reduces the dimensionality of the embeddings (typically high-dimensional) to 2D for visualization, preserving the structure of the data.
- **Syntactical Nuances**: 
  - The `umap` library is used, with `UMAP` initialized with `random_state=0` and `transform_seed=0` for reproducibility, ensuring consistent results across runs.
  - Embeddings are retrieved using `chroma_collection.get(include=['embeddings'])['embeddings']`, expecting a numpy array format, which is why `np` is imported.
  - `tqdm` is imported for progress bars, used later in the script.
  - The `fit` method trains the UMAP model on the embeddings.
- **Contribution**: This prepares the data for visualization by creating a UMAP transformer, enabling projection of embeddings into 2D space for later scatter plots, which helps understand document distribution.

##### Block 3: Defining the `project_embeddings` Function
```python
def project_embeddings(embeddings, umap_transform):
    umap_embeddings = np.empty((len(embeddings),2))
    for i, embedding in enumerate(tqdm(embeddings)): 
        umap_embeddings[i] = umap_transform.transform([embedding])
    return umap_embeddings   
```
- **Purpose**: This function takes a list of embeddings and a UMAP transformer, projecting each embedding into 2D space using the transformer. It uses a loop to apply the transformation individually, with `tqdm` for progress tracking.
- **Syntactical Nuances**: 
  - The function uses `np.empty((len(embeddings),2))` to create a numpy array for storing 2D projections, with shape `(number of embeddings, 2)`.
  - `enumerate(tqdm(embeddings))` provides both index and embedding, with `tqdm` showing progress.
  - The `transform` method of UMAP is called with `[embedding]` to ensure it's treated as a list, as UMAP expects.
- **Contribution**: This function is crucial for transforming high-dimensional embeddings into 2D for plotting, enabling visualization of both the entire dataset and specific query results in the embedding space.

##### Block 4: Projecting All Embeddings
```python
projected_dataset_embeddings = project_embeddings(embeddings, umap_transform)
```
- **Purpose**: This line applies the `project_embeddings` function to the entire set of embeddings, producing a 2D projection of all documents.
- **Syntactical Nuances**: No particular nuances; it's a straightforward function call.
- **Contribution**: Generates 2D projections of all documents, used in scatter plots to visualize the overall distribution of the dataset.

##### Block 5: Visualizing the Entire Dataset
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure()
plt.scatter(projected_dataset_embeddings[:, 0], projected_dataset_embeddings[:, 1], s=10)
plt.gca().set_aspect('equal', 'datalim')
plt.title('Projected Embeddings')
plt.axis('off')
```
- **Purpose**: This block creates a scatter plot of the 2D projected embeddings using matplotlib, setting the aspect ratio to equal and turning off the axis for a cleaner visualization.
- **Syntactical Nuances**: 
  - `plt.gca().set_aspect('equal', 'datalim')` ensures the plot is not distorted, preserving relative distances between points.
  - The scatter plot uses `s=10` for small point size, suitable for dense regions.
- **Contribution**: This visualization helps understand the distribution of documents in the embedding space, revealing clusters or patterns that might correspond to topics or sections in the annual report.

##### Block 6: Querying for "What is the total revenue?"
```python
query = "What is the total revenue?"

results = chroma_collection.query(query_texts=query, n_results=5, include=['documents', 'embeddings'])

retrieved_documents = results['documents'][0]

for document in results['documents'][0]:
    print(word_wrap(document))
    print('')
```
- **Purpose**: This block sets a query string ("What is the total revenue?") and queries the ChromaDB collection for the top 5 most similar documents. It then prints each retrieved document, wrapped for readability using `word_wrap`.
- **Syntactical Nuances**: 
  - The `query` method uses `query_texts` for the query, `n_results=5` to limit results, and `include=['documents', 'embeddings']` to return both.
  - `word_wrap` (from `helper_utils`) formats output for better readability, assumed to handle line breaks.
- **Contribution**: Demonstrates how to retrieve relevant documents based on a query using vector search, showcasing ChromaDB's core functionality.

##### Block 7: Projecting Query and Retrieved Embeddings
```python
query_embedding = embedding_function([query])[0]
retrieved_embeddings = results['embeddings'][0]

projected_query_embedding = project_embeddings([query_embedding], umap_transform)
projected_retrieved_embeddings = project_embeddings(retrieved_embeddings, umap_transform)
```
- **Purpose**: Generates the embedding for the query using the same embedding function, then projects both the query embedding and retrieved documents' embeddings into 2D space.
- **Syntactical Nuances**: 
  - `embedding_function([query])[0]` accounts for the embedding function returning a list, taking the first element for a single query.
  - `project_embeddings` is called twice, once for the query and once for retrieved embeddings.
- **Contribution**: Enables visualization of the query's position relative to retrieved documents, providing insight into retrieval effectiveness.

##### Block 8: Visualizing Query and Retrieved Documents
```python
plt.figure()
plt.scatter(projected_dataset_embeddings[:, 0], projected_dataset_embeddings[:, 1], s=10, color='gray')
plt.scatter(projected_query_embedding[:, 0], projected_query_embedding[:, 1], s=150, marker='X', color='r')
plt.scatter(projected_retrieved_embeddings[:, 0], projected_retrieved_embeddings[:, 1], s=100, facecolors='none', edgecolors='g')

plt.gca().set_aspect('equal', 'datalim')
plt.title(f'{query}')
plt.axis('off')
```
- **Purpose**: Creates a scatter plot showing all documents in gray, the query in red (as an 'X'), and retrieved documents in green (as circles).
- **Syntactical Nuances**: 
  - Uses different markers (`marker='X'` for query) and colors (`color='r'` for query, `edgecolors='g'` for retrieved) for distinction.
  - Aspect ratio set to equal for accurate representation.
- **Contribution**: Illustrates proximity of retrieved documents to the query in embedding space, aiding understanding of vector search effectiveness.

##### Remaining Query Blocks
The script includes additional query blocks for "What is the strategy around artificial intelligence (AI)?", "What has been the investment in research and development?", and "What has Michael Jordan done for us lately?". Each follows the structure of Blocks 6–8:
- Set query string.
- Query ChromaDB, retrieve documents and embeddings.
- Print retrieved documents.
- Generate and project query and retrieved embeddings.
- Visualize dataset, query, and retrieved documents.

The Michael Jordan query is notable, likely returning irrelevant results (e.g., mentions of "Jordan" as a country or unrelated names), illustrating limitations of vector search with ambiguous queries.
