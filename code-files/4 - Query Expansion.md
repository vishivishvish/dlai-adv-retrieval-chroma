### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Query Expansion Code

This section provides an in-depth analysis of the provided code, which is part of a lab exercise focused on query expansion techniques using Large Language Models (LLMs) for improving search results in a vector database, specifically for analyzing Microsoft's 2022 annual report. The code leverages ChromaDB for vector storage and OpenAI for text generation, aiming to enhance the relevance of retrieved documents through LLM-generated expansions. Below, we break down each code block, addressing what it accomplishes, syntactical nuances, and its contribution to the overall objective, with additional context from related research and tools.

#### Background and Context
Query expansion is a technique to improve information retrieval by augmenting the original query with additional terms or context, often using LLMs for generative capabilities. The code implements two methods: expanding with a hypothetical answer and generating multiple related questions, as inspired by research such as [Query Expansion by Prompting Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03653), which suggests LLM-generated expansions can outperform traditional methods like Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF). The current analysis, conducted at 08:13 PM IST on Wednesday, May 07, 2025, focuses on the code's structure and functionality.

#### Block-by-Block Analysis

##### Block 1: Imports
```python
from helper_utils import load_chroma, word_wrap, project_embeddings
from chromadb.utils.embedding_functions import SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction
```
- **Accomplishment**: This block imports necessary functions and classes from custom utilities (`helper_utils`) and ChromaDB. It includes `load_chroma` for loading data, `word_wrap` for text formatting, `project_embeddings` for visualization, and `SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction` for generating embeddings.
- **Syntactical Nuances**: 
  - `helper_utils` is a custom module, implying these functions are defined elsewhere, potentially in a separate file.
  - `SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction` is from ChromaDB's utilities, indicating reliance on the ChromaDB library, which is an open-source embedding database designed for AI applications, as detailed at [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/).
- **Contribution**: Sets up the foundational tools for working with embeddings and vector databases, essential for the query expansion process.

##### Block 2: Loading ChromaDB Collection
```python
embedding_function = SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction()

chroma_collection = load_chroma(filename='microsoft_annual_report_2022.pdf', collection_name='microsoft_annual_report_2022', embedding_function=embedding_function)
chroma_collection.count()
```
- **Accomplishment**: Initializes the embedding function using SentenceTransformer and loads a ChromaDB collection from the PDF file, then counts the number of items in the collection.
- **Syntactical Nuances**: 
  - `load_chroma` is a custom function, likely handling PDF parsing and embedding generation, with parameters for filename, collection name, and embedding function.
  - `chroma_collection.count()` retrieves the count of documents or embeddings, useful for verifying data loading.
- **Contribution**: Prepares the data source by loading the annual report into ChromaDB, enabling similarity searches, which is central to the query expansion objective.

##### Block 3: Setting up OpenAI API
```python
import os
import openai
from openai import OpenAI

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file
openai.api_key = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']

openai_client = OpenAI()
```
- **Accomplishment**: Configures the OpenAI API client by loading the API key from a .env file, enabling interactions with OpenAI's models for text generation.
- **Syntactical Nuances**: 
  - Uses `dotenv` for secure environment variable management, a common practice for handling sensitive information like API keys.
  - Initializes `openai_client` for making API calls, which is necessary for LLM-based query expansion.
- **Contribution**: Enables the use of LLMs for generating hypothetical answers and related questions, crucial for both query expansion techniques.

##### Block 4: UMAP Dimensionality Reduction
```python
import umap

embeddings = chroma_collection.get(include=['embeddings'])['embeddings']
umap_transform = umap.UMAP(random_state=0, transform_seed=0).fit(embeddings)
projected_dataset_embeddings = project_embeddings(embeddings, umap_transform)
```
- **Accomplishment**: Retrieves all embeddings from ChromaDB and applies UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to reduce their dimensionality to 2D for visualization.
- **Syntactical Nuances**: 
  - `chroma_collection.get(include=['embeddings'])['embeddings']` fetches the embeddings, with `include` specifying what to retrieve.
  - `umap.UMAP(random_state=0, transform_seed=0).fit(embeddings)` fits a UMAP model with fixed random seeds for reproducibility.

plt.gca().set_aspect('equal', 'datalim')
plt.title(f'{original_query}')
plt.axis('off')
```
- **Accomplishment**: Plots the projected embeddings, showing the dataset, retrieved documents, original query, and augmented query in a 2D scatter plot.
- **Syntactical Nuances**: 
  - Uses `matplotlib` for plotting, with different markers and colors for clarity (gray for dataset, green outline for retrieved, red X for original, orange X for augmented).
  - `plt.gca().set_aspect('equal', 'datalim')` ensures equal aspect ratio, and `plt.axis('off')` removes axes for a cleaner visualization.
- **Contribution**: Provides a visual representation to understand how query expansion affects search results, supporting the objective of improving relevance.

```python
def augment_multiple_query(query, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful expert financial research assistant. Your users are asking questions about an annual report. "
            "Suggest up to five additional related questions to help them find the information they need, for the provided question. "
            "Suggest only short questions without compound sentences. Suggest a variety of questions that cover different aspects of the topic."
            "Make sure they are complete questions, and that they are related to the original question."
            "Output one question per line. Do not number the questions."
        },
        {"role": "user", "content": query}
    ]

    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
